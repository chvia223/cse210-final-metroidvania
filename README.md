# NOTICE
I currently am unable to get this game to compile using .NET 6.0 on an Apple Silicon based Mac. If you manage to get it working please fork this repo and make a pull request.

# Overview


This is a small C# game project. When it's finally finished it should play like a basic metrovania side-scroller. This project's purpose was/is to get more familiar with C#, object oriented programming principles, and developing a robust game loop structure.
